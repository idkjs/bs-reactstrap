# bs-reactstrap

These are [Bucklescript](https://bucklescript.github.io/) bindings for [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).
Currently they are autogenerated based on propTypes. Everything complex (basically not `string` or `bool`) is just type variable.
ðŸš§ It is not completed, we are adding bindings as we go. Doesn't follow semver at this point. ðŸš§

# Install, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ahrefs/bs-reactstrap)
